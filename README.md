This project is about building a foundational LLM with the largest language Sanskrit

We are embarking on an ambitious project to develop a Sanskrit-based Large Language Model (LLM) that leverages the language's rich linguistic structure and extensive vocabulary. This initiative aims to advance artificial intelligence by creating a model that excels in clarity of speech and thought. To achieve this, we seek collaboration with experts across various fields.

**Project Overview**

Our goal is to create an LLM that utilizes Sanskrit's mathematical consistency and comprehensive grammatical framework. By integrating the 4,000 grammatical rules from Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī, we aim to develop a model with enhanced reasoning capabilities and reduced prediction errors. This model will have applications in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), machine translation, and more.

**Collaborative Platform**

We plan to utilize [Tanzabooks.com](https://tanzabooks.com/), a collaborative learning platform dedicated to improving learners' Clarity of Speech and Thought (COST). This platform captures both audio and text data, providing a valuable resource for our model's development.

**Call for Contributors**

We are seeking individuals with expertise in the following areas:

- **AI Research and Engineering:** Specialists in natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning to design and implement the model.

- **Sanskrit Linguistics:** Scholars with deep knowledge of Sanskrit grammar, semantics, and literature to guide data curation and ensure linguistic accuracy.

- **Data Science:** Professionals skilled in data sourcing, cleaning, and annotation to prepare high-quality datasets.

- **Software Development:** Engineers to handle the integration, deployment, and maintenance of the model.

- **Ethics and Bias Mitigation:** Experts to ensure the model adheres to ethical standards and minimizes biases.

**Project Roadmap**

1. **Team Assembly:** Gather a multidisciplinary team of experts.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Curate comprehensive Sanskrit texts from various domains.
   - Leverage Tanzabooks.com for additional data and to facilitate human learning.
   - Annotate data with the assistance of Sanskrit scholars.

3. **Model Architecture Design:**
   - Integrate Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī rules to enforce linguistic consistency.
   - Develop a custom tokenizer to capture Sanskrit's morphological nuances.
   - Design efficient neural networks tailored to Sanskrit grammar.

4. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development:**
   - Focus on creating a functional prototype that demonstrates the model's capabilities in ASR and machine translation.

5. **Collaboration and Community Building:**
   - Partner with academic institutions and research centers.
   - Encourage open-source contributions.
   - Organize workshops and seminars to share progress and gather feedback.

6. **Evaluation and Iteration:**
   - Benchmark the model's performance against existing LLMs.
   - Collect user feedback to refine capabilities.
   - Continuously improve based on evaluation results and technological advancements.
